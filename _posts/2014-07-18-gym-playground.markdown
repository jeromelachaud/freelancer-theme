intro: I started developing this app as a playground for teaching myself Kotlin and further developing my skills. While working on this app I got accustomed to the language intricacies and different android technologies.
my-role: Sole Developer from new project to current state. Design, App and Backend done by myself.
tech-talk:
  - For this playground I used Kotlin, View Bindings, Async Recycler View Adapters with DiffUtil, ViewModels, Retrofit2 for ApiCalls and Gson annotations. 
sections:
  - title: Routes section

    details: An avarage size gym can have over 100 climbing routes, 6 or more difficulty grades and locations. Finding a route can prove difficult, so I wanted to solve this problem. The home screen covers 2 main disciplines :&nbsp Lead Routes and Boulder Problems, ordered by difficulty or location. The preview picture shows a hold from the route and the border matches that hold color to easily find all the information needed. The user can mark them as Sent or tap the heart to like the route.
  - title: Event details
    media: /img/playground/event_details.webp
    details:  Admins can create events and competition. An event contains a schedule, a price and price packages, has a  registration area and for competition, live ranking. The event details part supports a text editor to easily format your text.
  - title: Add route
    media: /img/playground/add_route.webp
    details: Covers all information about a route:&nbsp Who set it, name, difficulty, colors, location and type. When adding the photo, the user can crop a round preview photo from the original. Later, both of them will be uploaded to Firebase Storage.
