description: Log is a simple record keeping application I am building with the intention of tracking the maintenence I perform to my vehicle but can be ultimately be used to track many objects and their progression. I intend to include the ability for the user to create different "logs" representing the object they wish to keep a record for. One log could be your vehicle, your bike or whatever; upon creation the user will add attributes to identify their new log. Within said log, the user can define different devices to track the object; initially the user will be able to create data tables, todo lists or just a scratch pad to keep notes. All user created data will be written to a firebase databse (if they have created an account) that way this data can be accessed from multiple devices anywhere.

### Progress Update for Feb 5, 2021 

So far, I have implemented my auth service (thanks to the amazing ui [ngx-auth-firebaseui](https://github.com/AnthonyNahas/ngx-auth-firebaseui) by Anthony Nahas) and now I am going onward to the database services. As it stands the app is set up with a Firebase I created and any new user that registers can create a log and see a selection on the sidebar of their currrent logs.

Further on the agenda is to make clean up the sidebar interface, and working on the main content area where the log data will be displayed and manipulated.
