aboutblurb:
  - content: This is a fork of the Freelancer Jekyll theme created by Start Bootstrap. The download includes the complete source files including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as optional LESS stylesheets for easy customization.
  - content: Because this is simply a landing page, posts have been removed. The portfolio grid was also removed.
  - content: More content customisation is now possible in _config.yml, including the button links (landing) and the 'about' section.
