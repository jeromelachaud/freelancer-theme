        <p class = "justi">Hello! I'm Pritesh Tadvi, an aspiring Data Scientist eager to embark on a journey in Data Science.</p>
<p class = "justi">I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology with distinction.</p>
<p class = "justi">My eagerness of learning something new drove me to DATA, to start with this I learned Python language for programming, to grasp good grip over python I worked as python developer intern, there I learned Django and Postgres. After that, I participate in a course called Google Data Analytics in which I learned R language, some libraries of R and Kaggle(for posting my project), in the process I also learned data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data tranformation etc... I also learned Advance Excel in another certification. I made few projects on my own in which I learned flask, pgAdmin, scikit-learn, MLflow and AWS.</p>
<p class = "justi">I am also good at Teaching and building network, I believe teaching enhances clarity in your fundamentals.</p>
<p class = "justi">I am thrilled about the possibilities that lie ahead in Data Science, and I'm eager to dive in, learn and grow every step of the way. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me.</p>
